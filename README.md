### Stretch Goals:

- Use the date object for the date and the date input type for the form.
- Use a pull-down menu to allow the user to select "Deposit" or "Withdrawal" in order to add or subtract the value.
- Make categories a select HTML element on the new/edit forms to allow the user to choose from a pull-down menu from the available categories.
- Landing page displays transactions sorted in descending order by date. 
- Added chartjs library to provide visualizations (doughnut chart).
